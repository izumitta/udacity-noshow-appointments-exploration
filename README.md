# Exploration of different factors related to patient show-ups for medical appointments
## by Julia Kinday


## Dataset

> In this progect I'll be analyzing data that collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. Each row includes a number of characteristics about the patient, among them: 
- scheduledDay tells on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- neighborhood indicates the location of the hospital.
- scholarship indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

## Summary of findings

> People of working age represent larger group of population and tend to miss their appointments more often. Among them women don't show up more often than men. In youth and eldery age groups there is no significcant difference in gender. The chart shows significant difference between boys and girls regarding showing up to their appointment but there is not enought data in this data set to look into this deeper and this group also strongly dependent on their parents.
> Almost 60% of patients who didn't show up for their appointment had less than 2 weeks waiting time and thus waiting time doesn't have strong influence over patiens attendance.
> People with chronic conditions like hipertension, diabetes, alcoholism and different types of disability show equally high tendency to miss their medical appointments. Since people of working age also have this tendency these two factors might be of use in prediction of whether patient show up or not. Limited amount of medical conditions presented in this data set and no data about household composition don't allow further exploration of these factors.
> Enrollment in Bolsa Família program does not seem to affect attendance of patients despite differences between population enrolled and not.
